To handle this form, you want to save marks for each employee's answers to the test questions. Here's how you can process this form:

1. **Form Submission Check:**
   Wrap the code that processes the form submission inside a check for whether the form has been submitted. You can do this using `isset($_POST['savemarks_btn'])`.

   ```php
   if (isset($_POST['savemarks_btn'])) {
       // Form submission code here
   }
   ```

2. **Loop Through Employees:**
   You have a loop that goes through all employees. For each employee, you display their details and the questions they answered.

3. **Display Questions and Answer Fields:**
   Inside the employee loop, you display each question along with its answer field. For each question, you show a dropdown/select input for marking.

4. **Retrieve and Save Marks:**
   When processing the form submission, you'll need to retrieve the selected marks from the dropdown/select inputs and save them to your database. You can do this within the loop.

   - Retrieve the selected mark for each question using `$_POST`.
   - Update the marks in your database.

5. **Validation:**
   You can add validation to ensure that a mark is selected for each question. If a mark is not selected, you can display an error message.

6. **Success/Failure Messages:**
   After processing the form, you can display success or failure messages to indicate whether the marks were saved successfully.

Here's an example of how you can structure your code:

```php
if (isset($_POST['savemarks_btn'])) {
    // Initialize error messages array
    $errors = array();
    $success = true;

    // Loop through employees
    foreach ($_POST['save_empl_id'] as $employee_id) {
        // Loop through questions for this employee
        foreach ($_POST['question_ids'] as $key => $question_id) {
            // Retrieve the selected mark for this question
            $selected_mark = $_POST['marks'][$key];
            
            // Validate that a mark is selected
            if ($selected_mark === 'Select marks') {
                $errors[] = "Select marks for Question $question_id for Employee $employee_id.";
                $success = false;
                continue; // Skip to the next iteration
            }

            // Update the marks in your database
            // Your database update code here
        }
    }

    if ($success) {
        // Display a success message
        echo '<p class="alert alert-success">Marks saved successfully.</p>';
    } else {
        // Display error messages
        foreach ($errors as $error) {
            echo '<p class="alert alert-danger">' . $error . '</p>';
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to adjust the code to match your database structure and naming conventions.
